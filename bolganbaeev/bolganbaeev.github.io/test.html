<ipython-input-17-ff165d091741>:2: MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning: The input passed in on this line looks more like a URL than HTML or XML.

    If you meant to use Beautiful Soup to parse the web page found at a certain URL, then something has gone wrong. You should use an Python package like 'requests' to fetch the content behind the URL. Once you have the content as a string, you can feed that string into Beautiful Soup.
    
    However, if you want to parse some data that happens to look like a URL, then nothing has gone wrong: you are using Beautiful Soup correctly, and this warning is spurious and can be filtered. To make this warning go away, run this code before calling the BeautifulSoup constructor:
    
        from bs4 import MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning
        import warnings
    
        warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning)
        
      Search.BeautifulSoup("https://9b-class.github.io")
